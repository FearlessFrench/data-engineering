But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget.
